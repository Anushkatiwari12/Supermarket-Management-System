# Supermarket-Management-System

# Overview
About the project
Final, practical project concluding the QA Academy Software Development Bootcamp.

The project consolidates the following concepts from the core training modules:

* Agile & Project Management (Git, Jira)
* Databases & Cloud Fundamentals (MySQL)
* Programming Fundamentals (Java)
* API Development (Spring Boot)
* Automated Testing (JUnit, Mockito)
The project consists of a Spring Boot API, produced with full CRUD (Create, Read, Updated and Delete) functionality. The API is fully capable of handling HTTP requests and communicates with a local database (MySQL).

About the API
The API consists of a Supermarket Management System.

There are four 'model' classes, or 'entities':

1. User
2. Category
3. Product
4. Order
Shoppers ('User') can choose a variety of products ('Product') across multiple product categories ('Category') in order to generate an order ('Order') that is stored within the database.
